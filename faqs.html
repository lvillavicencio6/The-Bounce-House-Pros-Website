            <div class="faq-question">2. Do you deliver to other cities not listed on your website?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, please be aware that due to rising gas prices and the possible need for an extra truck and labor that travel fees can be quite high. Please text us at (619) 370-8122 for a current quote.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">3. When do you set up and pick up?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Delivery will be between the hours of 7:00am and 12:00pm the morning of your event. If your event starts between our delivery window, we will deliver a day before. Pick up is the next day, unless same day pick up is requested. For special arrangements please text us at (619) 370-8122</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">4. What condition will our rentals arrive?</div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">5. Do we have to keep it plugged in the entire time?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes. An electric blower keeps air in the unit the entire time - if unplugged, it will deflate. We require an outlet within 50´ of the unit and we will provide an extension cord.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">6. What payments do you take?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Credit Card, Cash, Zelle or Venmo. If paying with cash, please have exact change as our drivers do not carry cash.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">7. Do you require deposit?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes, all orders require a credit card deposit to have your rental items secured. Deposit is credited towards the full payment. Deposits are non-refundable and the rest of the payment will be due at the time of delivery.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">8. What is your weather policy?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Please text us at (619) 370-8122 before 8:00am the morning of your party if you wish to cancel. We do deliver rentals in the rain. The only time we will not deliver your bounce house or tent is if winds are in excess of 25MPH. In the event you need to cancel your items please reply to the confirmation email that you received when you placed the order. Our staff will cancel the order and send a cancellation confirmation via email.
                Payments are NON-REFUNDABLE but can be credited toward another event within 180 days. If not used by that time the payment will be forfeited.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">9. Who will deliver our rentals?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Our drivers and delivery staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They will be wearing a 22 Jumpers t-shirt clearly identifying them as "Staff." Please feel free to ask our delivery team any questions you may have.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">10. How big are the jumpers?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Most of our jumpers are 13'x13'. Please note the space required for each jumper (listed near the large picture) as some are VERY big and require extra space. When in doubt, measure your space to make sure it will fit. Jumpers need room to be staked and they need room for the blower and can't rub against walls or trees as this may damage the jumper. The sizes listed with each jumper include the space needed for stakes etc. If you have stairs or a tiered backyard, please call our office to discuss options for setup</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">11. What about the big jumpers? Any special requirements?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Check the requirements listed with each jumper. Also, make sure you have at least a 4 feet of access to the area where it will be set up. The jumpers can weigh up to 650 pounds so we need a clear path with ample room.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">12. What surfaces do you set up on?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">We can set up on grass (our favorite and best for the kids), dirt, and concrete. Sorry, we can’t set up on any type of rock as the constant rubbing will wear through the rental equipment. If we are setting up on any surface other than grass please let us know ahead of time so that we can bring the proper equipment to safely setup.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">13. What kind of water supply will I need for my water inflatable?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">All we need is your garden hose to be hooked up to a water supply.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">14. Are we responsible for the unit if it gets a tear or damaged in any way?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes and no. You are not responsible for normal wear and tear on our units. Seams may develop tears in high traffic areas over a period of time. If this happens please alert us at once so we can remedy the situation. If however, damage occurs due to failure to follow our safety rules or negligence (i.e. not turning off the blower in high winds) you will be responsible for all damages up to and including replacement of the unit/blower etc which can cost thousands of dollars.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">15. Can inflatables be set up indoors?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Yes. All units are different sizes. We will work with you to determine if the rental you selected will fit in your location.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
